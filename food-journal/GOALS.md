# Nutrition Goals

Profile: 44-year-old male, 180 cm, 92 kg. Sedentary office work; limited time for structured exercise. Goal: gradual fat loss while preserving lean mass, sustainable and family-friendly.

## Daily Targets

- Calories: 2,100 kcal (deficit ≈ 15–20% from sedentary maintenance ~2,500 kcal)
- Protein: 140–170 g (≈ 1.5–1.8 g/kg body weight)
- Carbs: 200–240 g (adjust based on hunger/activity)
- Fats: 60–75 g (primarily unsaturated)
- Fiber: 30–40 g
- Water: 2.5–3.0 L

## Macro Distribution (approx)

- Protein: 27–32%
- Carbs: 38–45%
- Fats: 25–32%

## Meal Structure

- 3–4 eating occasions/day
  - Breakfast: optional; include protein if hungry
  - Lunch: protein + veg + smart carbs
  - Snack: fruit/yogurt/nuts as needed
  - Dinner: protein + veg; lighter carbs on low-activity days

## Weekly Activity (low time commitment)

- Walking: 7,000–9,000 steps/day average
- Strength micro-sessions: 2–3×/week, 10–15 min (push-ups, squats, rows/resistance band, planks)
- Mobility: 5–10 min/day (hips/shoulders/spine)

## Food Quality Priorities

- Emphasize: lean meats, fish, eggs, legumes, Greek yogurt; whole grains; colorful vegetables; fruit; olive oil, nuts/seeds
- Limit: ultra-processed snacks, sugary drinks; alcohol to ≤4–6 drinks/week
- Cooking: batch cook proteins and veggies; keep healthy snacks visible

## Practical Habits

- Breakfast or first meal: include 25–40 g protein
- Plate method at lunch/dinner: ½ vegetables, ¼ protein, ¼ starch
- Hydration cue: 1 glass water before each meal
- Mindful eating: slow down; stop at 7–8/10 fullness
- Sleep: aim 7–8 hours; consistent schedule helps appetite regulation

## Example Daily Goal Table (for journal)

| Nutritional Facts | Goal |
|-------------------|-----:|
| Calories          | 2100 |
| Carbs             | 230g |
| Fats              | 70g  |
| Proteins          | 160g |
| Fibers            | 35g  |
| Water             | 2500ml |

## Adjustments

- If weekly weight loss <0.2 kg for 2 weeks: reduce carbs/fats by ~10% (keep protein constant)
- If energy low or activity higher: add 150–250 kcal via carbs/protein
- High-social days (parties): prioritize protein/veg earlier; hydrate; limit desserts/alcohol quantity
