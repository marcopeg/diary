Morning protein foundations set (pulled pork tastings + snack). Lunch added a chicken wrap with truffle mayo, 1 chicken nugget, and 3 more coffees with milk: substantial protein and fats; carbs moderate; fiber still low. Mid-day totals: ~907 cal, ~57g protein. Focus next on fiber (veg/whole grains) and lean protein to avoid overshooting fats while advancing toward 160g protein.
