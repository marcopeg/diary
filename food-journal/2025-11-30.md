Protein steadily accumulated through pork tastings, wrap, and snacks. Dinner (pork + salad + 2 yellow kiwis) pushed protein high (~128g ≈80% of goal) while fats are effectively capped (~99%). Kiwi addition improved fiber and micronutrients; carbs remain moderate. For any night intake, favor lean protein and high fiber with negligible fat.
