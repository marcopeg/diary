Protein steadily accumulated through pork tastings, wrap, and snacks. Dinner (pork + salad + 2 yellow kiwis) pushed protein high (~129g ≈81% of goal) while late sweets nudged fats slightly above target (~109%). Kiwi addition improved fiber and micronutrients; carbs remain moderate. For any night intake, favor lean protein and high fiber with negligible added sugar.
